developmentally challenged districts across sectors such as health and nutrition; education; agriculture

Jamui is also included in the list of aspirational districts which are mostdevelopmentally challenged districts across sectors such as health and nutrition; education; agricultureand water resources; basic infrastructure; and financial inclusion and skill development.<br><br>The scene of marginalized people suffering from the scarcity of basic necessity materials, lack of knowledge about the preventive measure of virus and lack of money to purchase medicines for people with covid symptoms made him restless. He searched for several people and organizations who were supporting covid relief initiatives with resources at that time and contacted them. He used his education as a tool to bridge the gap between resources and the needy people in his locality and surrounding and had a direct impact in the lives of thousands of people.<br><br>It was during this time, when he interacted with community members closely and got to know aboutthe challenges that fellow human beings are facing. His interest grew more in community service anddesigning innovative models for involvement of Youth in community services. He realized that his fellow young friends are not as inclined as he is in community services. They were not conscious enough of the challenges marginalized people are facing in their daily walk of life.<br><br>After that, he visited several small and bigger schools of the district to interact with the students and know about their opinion on social issues and found that many of them were not even well aware about the issues that matter to the generation, and some of them who were aware, weren’t conscious about them. When students from class VII, VIII and IX were asked about SDGs, surprisingly many ofthem had not even heard about them and some had just heard and nothing more.<br><br>He traced the need of cultivating social conscience among the young generation and this led to hissocial startup YSpark, which is primarily working for nurturing social conscience among the younger generation in schools and driving grassroot impact in line with UN’s SDGs 2030. We firmlybelieve that change is our collective responsibility and just like we talk about corporate social responsibility, everyone on the planet has their individual social responsibility and we need to make them conscious about it through an educational approach from a young age."
